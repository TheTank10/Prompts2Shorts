# Video Settings Guide

This guide explains each setting in the video settings file used to control how your videos are generated. These settings are saved in JSON format (like `default.json`) and can be customized for different projects. When no settings are provided when running the `--create` command, the `default.json` settings are automatically used `data/settings/video_settings/default.json`

To use a custom settings file, pass it into your command using:

```bash
--settings="mycustomsettings"  # or use the shorthand -st (do not include the json extension)
```

## Tips for Customization

* **AI Model Selection:** Use larger models like `openai-large` or `deepseek-reasoning` for higher quality scripts. Use smaller ones (like `openai-fast`) for faster generation. Use image models like `flux` for balanced image making. Use faster image models like `turbo` for very quick image generation (perfect for NSFW by the way). `gptimage` as of this day requries a key you get from pollinations even tho they say that their services are supposed to be free and keyless... 
* **Consistent Results:** Set a `seed` value to generate consistent outputs with the same prompt.
* **Video Format:** Use `1080x1920` for vertical video. Use `1920x1080` for horizontal.
* **Text Visibility:** Tweak `font_size`, `font_outline`, and `font_shadow` for readability.
* **Color Styling:** Use [htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) to choose hex colors.
* **Subtitle Animation:** Lower `subtitle_entry_ms` to make words pop up quicker. Edit `subtitle_init_scale_percentage` to control the starting size of the subtitle when it first enters the video (set to 100 to disable)
* **CUDA Troubleshooting:** Set `force_cuda` to `true` only if youâ€™re sure your system supports it. Otherwise, leave it `false` for automatic detection.

## Common Issues

**Font Not Found Error**

> This happens when the font name is incorrect or the font file is missing from `data/fonts/`. The name should match the fontâ€™s internal name, not the filename. Open the `.ttf` file to confirm the actual font name or upload it into a font website to get its actual internal name.

---

you can use the `--getmodels` command to view available text and image models provided by pollinations.ai.
